# sunny-s-bookshelf

This is a prototype for a recommendation system featuring in a larger application.
This feature recommends books based on a user's mood description. By analyzing the user's input text, the system determines an emotional profile and suggests books that align with the user's current mood. The recommendation system is built using Flask for the backend, Streamlit for the frontend, and a pretrained NLP model for mood classification.

# Warning: Do not attempt to run since it is only a prototype, not a complete web app.
